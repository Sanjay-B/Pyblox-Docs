Pyblox was created in hopes of providing novice to high level coders a proper interface
that's easy to understand. Pyblox handles all requests, parses the responses and returns
easily readable information. There will be no effort towards backwards-compatibility.

Pyblox was written in Python 3+ utilizing the Request library.
